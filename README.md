# Grider - The Grid Creator
Create, customize and export grids on top of reference images, for drawing guidance, a tool for artists and those learning how to draw. [https://splitpainter.itch.io/grider](https://splitpainter.itch.io/grider)

![Output](example_output.jpg)

With Grider you load a reference image, customize different grids on top of it and then export the grid and import it into your your prefered drawing application to use as a drawing guidance. Since the exported grid is a PNG image, you can also print it and modify as needed.

Grider also exports the grid on top of the reference image, as a separate file.

The Grids produced allow you to learn and draw following **the Leonardo Da Vinci method**.
